### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**Asts77/Asts77** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on electronic information engineering and in particular, in the radar area.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the SVM and some neural network model, and contributing to use the neural network model to deal with the signal in the radar area.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on the radar and computer science.
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with the neural network, machine learning and deep learning.

Welcome to my page! And have a good time!
