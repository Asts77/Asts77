### Hi there 👋


**Asts77/Asts77** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on electronic information engineering and in particular, in the radar area.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the SVM and some neural network model, and contributing to use the neural network model to deal with the signal in the radar area.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on the radar and computer science.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with the neural network, machine learning and deep learning.


Welcome to my page! And have a good time!

It's a little boring if there are nothing but words. So I'd like to add some pictures to make it more attractive.
